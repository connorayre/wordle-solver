## I, Connor Ayre, specifically developed the calculate_entropy function in the file located at wordle-solver/src/wordle_ai.py starting at line 208 as well as aided in the rest of the software.




# wordle-solver

Welcome.
Currently using Python 3.8.9.
Stuff is in the wiki, please feel free to add info. Could maybe help with the presentation.
## Some info:
Clone the repository via SSH using:
`$ git clone git@github.com:1112zakaria/wordle-solver.git`
This will create a new directory named "wordle-solver" containing the repo contents.
I know there exist other ways to clone, but I only know how to do so via SSH and terminal. Please ask if you need help.

Please create a virtual environment locally on your machine under this "wordle-solver" directory using:

```$ python3 -m venv .env```

This will create a "hidden" directory.

Activate the python3 virtual environment using:

```source .env/bin/activate```

Your terminal will now look like:

```(.env) zakaisma@ZAKAISMA-M-XGTY wordle-solver % ```

Install all current dependencies using (haven't tried this out yet):

```$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

If you need to install any new libraries, use:

```$ pip3 install <library name>```

and then update requirements.txt using:

```$ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt```

Run tests from wordle-solver directory using:

```$ python3 -m tests.run_tests```


## Dependencies

TBD
